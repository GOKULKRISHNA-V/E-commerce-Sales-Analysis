# E-Commerce Sales Analysis
Here I analyzed the sales data of zepto to derive the business insights using tools SQL and PowerBI.
## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze sales data across multiple product categories and understand how discounts, pricing, and stock availability impact total revenue.
I built an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore sales performance, identify revenue drivers, and detect operational issues such as stockouts.

The dashboard combines category analysis, discount analysis, price segmentation, and stock status, giving a complete 360° view of business performance.

## Problem Statement

The company wanted to answer key questions:

- Which categories contribute the most revenue?
- Are discounts driving sales, or are customers buying without offers?
- Which price segments perform the best?
- What percentage of products are out of stock?
- How does inventory affect revenue across categories?

This dashboard was built to support pricing strategy, inventory planning, and promotion decisions.

## Dataset

[zepto_sales.csv]()

## Tools & Techniques Used

Data Processing:

- Cleaned and transformed the dataset using MySQL.
- Performed calculations for revenue, discount %, stock status.

Visualization:

- Built interactive dashboards in Power BI
- Used bar charts, donut charts, KPI cards, and slicers

## Business Insights derived from the Sales Dashboard:

1. Revenue Concentration
 - Total revenue is ₹12B, with Chocolates & Candies, Ice Creams, and Grocery Staples contributing the highest share.
 - These top categories alone generate over 30% of total revenue, indicating strong customer preference for FMCG essentials and snacks.
2. Customer Discount Behavior
 - 56% of revenue comes from Low Discount products, proving customers do not rely heavily on discounts.
 - Higher discount ranges (>20%) generate the least revenue, showing discounts are not the primary sales drivers.
3. Price Segment Performance
 - Luxury products (₹200) contribute the largest revenue segment (>50%).
 - Budget segment contributes the least, suggesting customers prefer quality over cheapest options.
4. Inventory Health
 - Stock-out rate is 12%, which can directly reduce potential sales.
 - Several high-revenue categories (e.g., Dairy, Beverages) show out-of-stock items → restocking could increase revenue.
5. Category-Level Observations
 - Categories like Pet Food, Fruits & Vegetables, and Baby Products have lower revenue → may need marketing, bundling, or pricing strategy.

## Final Outcome
   
The dashboard enables the business to:

  - Identify revenue-driving categories
  - Optimize discount and pricing strategy
  - Reduce lost sales by fixing stockouts
  - Improve overall decision-making using data insights

This project demonstrates my ability to use data cleaning, visualization, and analytical storytelling to convert raw data into actionable insights.
